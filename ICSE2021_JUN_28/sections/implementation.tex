\subsection{Implementation}
We implement \tool{} with 16,729 lines of code in C++17 and Python from scratch. It has three
components, Intel Pin tool that can collect the execution trace, the
instruction-level symbolic execution engine, and the backend that can estimate
the information leakage. 


Our current implementation supports most Intel 32-bit instructions,
including bitwise operations, control transfer, data movement, and logic
instructions, which are essential in finding memory-based side-channel
vulnerabilities. The tool will use the real values to update the registers and memory
cells for other instructions that the current implementation does not support. 
Therefore, the tool may miss some leakages but will not give us any new false positives. 
\cready{We will release \tool{} for public dissemination
after the paper is published.}{}
