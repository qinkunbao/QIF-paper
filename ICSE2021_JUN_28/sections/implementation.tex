\subsection{Implementation}
\tool{} consists of 16,729 lines of code in C++17 and Python. It has three
components: an Intel Pin tool that collects the execution trace, the
instruction-level symbolic execution engine, and the backend that estimates
the information leakage. 

Our current implementation supports most Intel 32-bit instructions that are essential to find memory-based side-channel
vulnerabilities, including bitwise operations, control transfer, data movement, and logic
instructions. The tool uses the real values to update the registers and memory for instructions that the implementation does not support. 
Therefore, the tool may miss some leakages but will not raise false positives.
