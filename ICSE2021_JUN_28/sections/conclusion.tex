\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents a novel  %definition and
method to
quantify memory-based side-channel leakage. We implement the method in
a prototype called \tool{} and show its effectiveness in finding
and quantifying side-channel leakage. With the new definition of
information leakage that models actual side-channel attackers, quantifying the number of
leaked bits helps understand the severity level
of side-channel vulnerabilities. The evaluation confirms that \tool{} is useful in estimating the amount of leaked information in
real-world applications.
