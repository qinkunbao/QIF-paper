\begin{abstract}

  Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive information based
  on non-functional characteristics. Existing works on software side-channel
  detections identify numerous potential vulnerabilities. 
  However, in practice, many such vulnerabilities leak a negligible amount of
  sensitive information, and thus developers are often reluctant to address
  them.  On the other hand, no existing tools can precisely report the number of
  leaked bits for each leakage site for production systems.
  
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method to precisely quantify
  the leaked information from side-channel vulnerabilities. Our quantification
  method is dramatically different from previous methods, and the results are
  confirmed to be much more precise and usable in practice. We model an
  attacker's observation of each leakage site as a constraint.  
  We scale symbolic execution to production software to generate the
  constraints and then run Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the number of leaked
  bits for each vulnerability. By using the Central Limit Theorem, we can also give the error bound for estimation.
  
  We have implemented the above technique in a tool called \tool{}, which can
  not only find the side-channel vulnerabilities but also estimate how many
  bits are leaked. \tool{} outperforms existing dynamic side-channel
  detection tools in terms of performance and accuracy. Also, \tool{} can
  report a very fine-grained vulnerability leakage information.  
  We evaluate \tool{} on OpenSSL, mbedTLS and Monocypher\@.  
  Our results show that most of the reported vulnerabilities are hard to
  exploit in practice.  We also find several sensitive vulnerabilities that
  are missed by the existing tools. We confirm those vulnerabilities with
  manual checks and by the developers.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
