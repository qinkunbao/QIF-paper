\begin{abstract}

Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive information based
on non-functional characteristics. Existing works on side-channel
detections identify numerous potential vulnerabilities. 
However, in practice, many such vulnerabilities leak a negligible amount of
sensitive information, and thus developers are often reluctant to address
them. However, no existing tools can precisely report the number of
leaked bits for each leakage site in production systems.
  
We propose a new program analysis method to precisely quantify the 
leaked information in a single-trace attack through side-channels to overcome this limitation.
It can identify covert information flows in programs that can expose 
confidential information and reason about security flaws 
that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible, for a developer to find.
We model an attacker's observation of each leakage site as a constraint.  
We scale symbolic execution to production software to generate the
constraints and then run Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the number of leaked
bits for each leakage site. By using the Central Limit Theorem, 
we can also give the error bound for estimation.
  
We have implemented the above technique in a tool called \tool{}, which can
not only find the side-channel vulnerabilities but also estimate how many
bits are leaked. \tool{} outperforms existing dynamic side-channel
detection tools in terms of performance and accuracy. Also, \tool{} can
report a very fine-grained vulnerability leakage information.  
We evaluate \tool{} on OpenSSL, mbedTLS, Libgcrypt, and Monocypher\@.  
Our results show that most of the reported vulnerabilities are hard to
exploit in practice, which can dramatically improve
the process of vulnerability report triage for the developers.
We also find several sensitive vulnerabilities that
are missed by the existing tools. We confirm those vulnerabilities with
manual checks and by the developers.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.
