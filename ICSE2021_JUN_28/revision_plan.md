What we need to do:

Cite and discuss the missed related work.

Adding the missed related work mentioned by reviewer A and any additional related work.



Fix the typos and improve the grammar.

Fix the typos mentioned by the reviewers. I will use some tools like cspell and Grammarly.



Provide a link to the tool and benchmarks.

We can share the tool and benchmarks with an anonymous URL and include the URL in the paper.



Include a discussion on the differences between Abacus and DATA and on the secret-dependent memory access vulnerabilities when comparing Abacus and CatchD.

I plan to write a discussion from the below aspects.

Abacus is faster than DATA and CacheD.
DATA has a lot of false positives.
Abacus can discover all the vulnerabilities found by CacheD. Abacus can also discover the OpenSSLvulnerabilities discussed in Appendix A.

What we want to do:
1. Do a more thorough comparison with DATA. (We can also report the false positives of DATA for our benchmarks)

2. Run Abacus on more different versions of Cryptography Libraries

3. Run Abacus on previously fixed side-channel vulnerabilities.
