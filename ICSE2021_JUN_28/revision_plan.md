- Cite and discuss the missed related work.

   Adding the missed related work mentioned by reviewer A and any additional related work.



-  Fix the typos and improve the grammar.

   Fix the typos mentioned by the reviewers. I will use some tools like cspell and Grammarly.



- Provide a link to the tool and benchmarks.

  We can share the tool and benchmarks with an anonymous URL and include the URL in the paper.



- Include a discussion on the differences between Abacus and DATA and on the secret-dependent memory access vulnerabilities when comparing Abacus and CatchD.

  Abacus is faster than DATA and CacheD.
  DATA has a lot of false positives.
  Abacus can discover all the vulnerabilities found by CacheD. Abacus can also discover the OpenSSLvulnerabilities discussed in Appendix A.

- Do a more thorough comparison with DATA. (We can also report the false positives of DATA for our benchmarks)

- Run Abacus on more different versions of Cryptography Libraries

-  Run Abacus on previously fixed side-channel vulnerabilities.
