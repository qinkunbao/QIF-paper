Dear reviewers,

Thank you for the help review.

Over the past two weeks, we have gone through the detail of each comment and try to improve the paper in the following aspects.

1. Cite and discuss the missed related work
We cited the missed work pointed by reviewers. We also included a short discussion on the paper.

In addition, we added citations to the following work.

D. Moghimi et al. "CopyCat: Controlled Instruction-Level Attacks on Enclaves", USENIX Security 2020
L. Bang et al. "String analysis for side channels with segmented oracles", FSE 2016

We expanded the discussion on DATA and CacheD on Section VIII. 

2. Fix the typos and improve grammar.
We have revised the paper multiple times and corrected many minor clarity and English usage problems. The current draft included more than 200+ small changes.
We will continue polishing the paper.

3. Provide a link to the tool and benchmarks.
Abacus is open source. We added the link in the paper. The repository also contains benchmarks, metadata, and results of our experiments.

4. Include a discussion on the differences between Abacus and DATA.
We have included some additional discussion and analysis on p.8 and p.10.

5.  Add more implementation details.
We expended Section V to explain more technical details about Abacus.
