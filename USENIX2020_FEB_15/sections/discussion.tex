\section{Discussions and Limitations}
\tool{} estimates the amount of leaked information for each side-channels
in particular executions. \tool{} is useful for software
engineers to tests programs and fix vulnerabilities.
\tool{} works on native x86 execution traces. The design, which is very
precise in terms of true leakages compared to other static source code
method~\cite{197207,BacelarAlmeida:2013:FVS:2483313.2483334}, can omit
leakages on other traces. However, as the tool is intended for debugging,
we think it is software engineers' responsibilty to select the input and trigger the 
path in which they are interested.

While recent works have reported lots
of potential side-channel vulnerabilities, we find most of them are not patched by
developers because they do not think those vulnerabilities are severe enough.
However, side-channels are inevitable in software. In fact, many of them
are easily spotted but it is hard to fix all of them. They need to a
tool that can automatically estimate the sensitive level of each vulnerabilities.
Second, addressing old vulnerabilities may also introduce new leakage
sites. Our evaluation result also confirms that many of them are not 
severe and can be safely ignored. So software engineers can focus on
``severe'' leakages. For example, our tool will report that 
the modular exponentiation with square and multiply algorithms can
leak much information than a key length validation function.


For RSA, the latest
OpenSSL only has one leakage site that can leak more than 3 bits while there
are 22 leakage sites according to \tool{}. DES implementation of OpenSSL has
several sensitive leakages, but given the end life status of DES, it is still
unpatched because of the worth of engineering effort. 
%% At the early stage of the
%% project, we hope to find some sensitive leakages but are neglected by
%% communities for years. But somehow every sensitive leakages identified by

%\tool{} works on the native x86 instructions, while some existing
%works~\cite{197207,BacelarAlmeida:2013:FVS:2483313.2483334} find side-channels
%vulnerabilities from source code level or intermediate languages (e.g., VEX,
%REIL). Apart from the scalability issues for IR implementations, \tool{} is
%designed to work on the native x86 instructions for the following
%considerations. First, compliers can introduce or mitigate side channels
%vulnerabilities. For example, the GCC compiler may or may not translate the $!$
%operator into conditional branches. If the branch is secret-dependent, the
%attacker could learn some sensitive information. However, source-based methods
%fail to know how those the machine code looks like, which leads to false
%positives or false negatives.  
%Second, we find many crypto libraries have lots of inlined assembly code. In
%general, it is hard to convert assembly code into source code or IR.
