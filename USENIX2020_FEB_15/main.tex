% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

\title{\tool{}: Precise, Scalable, and Fine-grained Side-channel Information Leakage Quantification for Production Software}
\author{Anonymous}

\begin{abstract}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive information based
on non-functional characteristics. Existing work on software side-channel
detections can identify numerous potential vulnerabilities.
%side-channel leakage sites.
However, in practice, many such vulnerabilities leak a negligible amount of
sensitive information, and thus developers are often reluctant to address
them.
%Those leakage sites can leak one bit, two bits, or many bits.
On the other hand, no existing tools can precisely report the number of
leaked bits for each leakage site for production systems.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method to precisely quantify
the leaked information from side-channel vulnerabilities. Our quantification
method is dramatically different from previous methods, and the results are
confirmed to be much more precise and usable in practice. We model each
leakage as a constraint.
%  and use these constraints to divide the input space into subsets such
%  that  %.  Among those subsets, only one subset satisfies every
%  constraint.  %As we discuss later, The cardinality of the subset
%  corresponds to the amount of leaked information from those leakages. 
We scale  symbolic execution to production software to generate the
constraints
% It is widely believed that symbolic execution is expensive in terms of
% performance. We systematically analyze the bottlenecks of the current
% dynamic symbolic execution approach and make it scalable to real-world
% crypto systems.
and then run Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the number of leaked
information.
% for each detected vulnerability.
By using
%With the help of
the Central Limit Theorem, we can also give the error bound for estimation.

We have implemented the above technique in a tool called \tool{}, which can
not only find the side-channel vulnerabilities but also estimate how many
bits are leaked.  \tool{} outperforms existing dynamic side-channel
detection tools in terms of performance and accuracy. Also, \tool{} can
report a very fined-grained vulnerability leakage information.
% Compared to existing abstract interpretation approaches that can only give
% upper leakage bounds, the information reported by our tool is more useful
% for developers to identify the severity level of each side-channel
% vulnerability.
We evaluated \tool{} on OpenSSL and Mbed TLS\@.
%, and found several severe side-channel vulnerabilities. Compared with
%previous research, the results are surprisingly different.
Our results show that most of the reported vulnerabilities are hard to
exploit in practice.  We also find several sensitive vulnerabilities that
are missed by the existing tools. We confirmed those vulnerabilities with
manual checks and by the developers.
