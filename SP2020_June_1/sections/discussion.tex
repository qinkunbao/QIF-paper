\section{Discussions and Limitations}
In the section, we discuss the limitations, usages, and some future work.

\tool{} works on native x86 execution traces. The design, which is very
precise in terms of true leakages compared to other static source code
method~\cite{197207,BacelarAlmeida:2013:FVS:2483313.2483334}, also has 
the common limitations of dynamic approaches. \tool{} may only cover part of the code.
  % Each time we only get one single execution trace. Therefore,
We may 
neglect some side-channel vulnerabilities not covered by the traces analyzed.
However, this is not a crucial problem for analyzing crypto libraries because crypto
libraries are designed to have the same code coverage for various inputs. Our
evaluation also confirms the above point. For symmetric encryptions, during our
evaluation there is no secret-dependent control-flow transfers. RSA
implementations have several secret-dependent control-flow transfers. 
  %But after we manually check those leakages cites. We find
Most of them are  %used for
bound checks, which do not leak much information and have negligible effects
on the whole code coverage as well.

One of the motivations of \tool{} is that while recent works have reported lots
of potential side-channel vulnerabilities, most of them are not patched by
developers. Our evaluation result confirms that most of them are not severe and can be safely ignored.
For RSA, the latest
OpenSSL only has one leakage site that can leak more than 3 bits while there
are 22 leakage sites according to \tool{}. DES implementation of OpenSSL has
several sensitive leakages, but given the end life status of DES, it is still
unpatched for the worth of engineering effort. 
%% At the early stage of the
%% project, we hope to find some sensitive leakages but are neglected by
%% communities for years. But somehow every sensitive leakages identified by
%% \tool{} are known to people before. We think the main reason is that we only
%% test famous crypto algorithms in well-known crypto libraries. Those code bases
%% have been studied for years. So it is unlikely to have unknown sensitive
%% leakages.
%% We leave the task of applying \tool{} on other libraries and
%% non-crypto libraries in the future.
%
In the future, we would like to apply \tool{} on other libraries including 
non-crypto ones. 

%\tool{} works on the native x86 instructions, while some existing
%works~\cite{197207,BacelarAlmeida:2013:FVS:2483313.2483334} find side-channels
%vulnerabilities from source code level or intermediate languages (e.g., VEX,
%REIL). Apart from the scalability issues for IR implementations, \tool{} is
%designed to work on the native x86 instructions for the following
%considerations. First, compliers can introduce or mitigate side channels
%vulnerabilities. For example, the GCC compiler may or may not translate the $!$
%operator into conditional branches. If the branch is secret-dependent, the
%attacker could learn some sensitive information. However, source-based methods
%fail to know how those the machine code looks like, which leads to false
%positives or false negatives.  
%Second, we find many crypto libraries have lots of inlined assembly code. In
%general, it is hard to convert assembly code into source code or IR.
